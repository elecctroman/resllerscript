# Lotus Licenses WooCommerce Theme

This directory contains a bespoke WordPress theme inspired by the Lotus Lisans storefront. The theme is engineered for software license resellers who require stunning landing pages, SEO-friendly markup, and deep WooCommerce integration.

## Key Features
- Conversion-driven front page with hero, features, product grid, testimonials, and CTA sections.
- Automatic plugin bootstrapper that installs/activates WooCommerce, Elementor, Contact Form 7, and Yoast SEO when the theme is enabled.
- Fully responsive layout powered by Plus Jakarta Sans typography and modern gradient styling.
- Translation-ready strings and Customizer controls for hero content and highlight metrics.
- Tailored WooCommerce styling with featured product cards and CTA-driven merchandising.

## Installation
1. Copy the `lotus-licenses` folder into your WordPress installation under `wp-content/themes/`.
2. Activate the theme via **Appearance → Themes**. On activation, the theme will attempt to install and activate the recommended plugins.
3. Set the **Homepage** to use the "Front page" template under **Settings → Reading**.
4. Customize the hero copy, CTA text, and highlight metrics in the WordPress Customizer.

## Development Notes
- Global styles live in `style.css`, while presentation layers are in `assets/css/theme.css`.
- JavaScript enhancements (sticky header, testimonial carousel) live in `assets/js/theme.js`.
- Template partials reside in `template-parts/` and can be modified to fit additional marketing sections.
